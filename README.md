# ruby-tic-tac-toe

![screenshot](./images/output.png)

In this project we will recreate the well known Tic-Tac-Toe game by using object oriented programming paradigm. We have 4 milestones as below:

- [x] Miltestone 1 - Basic initial setups and linter configurations.
- [x] Miltestone 2 - CLI user interface is implemented.
- [x] Miltestone 3 - Game logic is implemented and the main user interface moved to Main class.
- [x] Miltestone 4 - Instructions and Rules for game

# Game Rules

- Two players can start game by entering their names
- Player names should contain at least one letter
- Game board consists of 3 by 3 grid and 9 locations.
- x sign for game belongs to Player1 and o sign belongs to Player2
- No player can put move in a place which is already filled
- Game board will check if a player wins after every move
- If no player wins it's a draw

## Built With

- Rubocop

## Live Demo

[Live Demo Link](https://repl.it/@remki/ruby-tic-tac-toe-game-1#bin/main.a)

## Testing the game

This game was tested using [RSpec](https://rspec.info/) which is a ruby testing tool. We tested all the public methods of the project Tic Tac Toe.

### Install

- In a terminal window type gem install rspec
- Once rspec install has finished, go to project directory and type rspec --init
- You will see a folder spec and a file .rspec
- Inside spec folder you'll see a spec_helper.rb file.

### Run the test
- Open a terminal window and type rspec
- All tests should be passed:
